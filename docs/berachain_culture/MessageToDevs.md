# Version 1: Direct & Professional with Berachain Flair

Hey Devs & Mods,

Been noticing the flood of role-related questions? I built a solution that could help streamline things. Before rolling it out broadly, wanted to get the dev gang's eyes on it.

## What's Beratrack?
A real-time role analytics dashboard that:
- Shows live role distribution & status
- Tracks engagement metrics
- Monitors historical changes
- Provides instant role status checks

## The Data Story
Two weeks of server analysis revealed:
- 2,044 unique users asking about roles (13.6%)
- 7,230+ role-related messages
- 50% concentrated in one channel

## Next Steps
This is v0.1, focusing on roles as our first target. With your input, we can expand this into a broader community analytics platform.

Looking for mods to help verify data accuracy before public release.

Demo & walkthrough coming soon.

Stack: Next.js, Shadcn, Firebase, BigQuery üçØ

# Version 2: Community Hype (IYKYK)

YO DEV FAM! üêª

The "wen role" spam is getting wild and I think I got something BASED to fix it. Wanted the dev gang to peep it first...

## BEHOLD... BERATRACK
- Real-time role stats (no cap)
- Open/closed status instantly
- Activity tracking (IYKYK)
- Historical data go brrr

Found some wild numbers:
2k+ of us asking about roles
7k+ messages (we do be asking)
Half in one channel (oof)

v0.1 is ready for dev eyes üëÄ
Let's make it perfect before the community gets their hands on it

Built on that BASED stack (Next.js/Shadcn/Firebase/BigQuery) üçØ

# Version 4: Problem-Solution Format

Hey dev gang,

Problem:
- 2k+ users asking about roles
- 7k+ messages to sort through
- Mods repeating the same info
- No central source of truth

Solution: Beratrack
A real-time dashboard that answers the common questions automatically:
- Which roles are open?
- What's the activity level?
- How's the distribution?
- What's changing over time?

Built it with Next.js, Shadcn, Firebase, and BigQuery. Looking for dev feedback before we ship to the broader community.

Demo instance and walkthrough coming soon.
